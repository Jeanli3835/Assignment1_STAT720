If you don't set your HTML preferences for "self-contained" <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#self-contained>, I won't be able to read the version you have pushed to the repo ...

You can clean up your output by also including `message=FALSE` in the options for the chunk where you load packages ...

check_singularity and isSingular use different thresholds (1e-5 vs 1e-4) for determining "close to zero"

try to spell-check ...

`(0+sex+social|primary)+(1|primary)` doesn't work as you'd expect it to (I explained this in class on Friday, it's also in the notes on simplification (note that the sexM variable has 0 variance ...)

You could get rid of the warnings about matrix scaling by using `drop(scale(...))`

"However, it is important to note that there may be greater prediction errors." -- what does that mean?

f): definitely try to condense these results!

h): nice condensed presentation (fewer significant digits would be good)

I'm suspicious of your results, I don't think SA and KR results should be identical to 4 decimal places ...

i) spell-check! ("froup")

j, k) I was looking for a *conceptual* reason ...
